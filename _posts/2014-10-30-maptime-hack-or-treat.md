[Arup](http://www.arup.com) opens its awesome space to us for the night!

The idea is to bring and exchange ideas to work on together.  We're all going different speeds and have different backgrounds:  this is like office hours when you can ask a member for tips on something, like GitHub or Leaflet etc., as well as connect with someone who is interested in working on the same type of project.

This format will be more common in future meetups.  Hopefully it will also yield some things to show off at GIS day too!
